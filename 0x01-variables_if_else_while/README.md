# 0x01 C - Variables, if, else, while

## About
This project introduces variables, `if..else`, and `while` statements in C langauge.

## Requirements
- All files are crated and complied on Ubuntu 14.04. 
- All files are tested by [Bettty](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki) for Syntax and style. 

## File Descriptions

| Filename  | Description      |
| --------- | --------------   |
| 0-positive_or_negative.c | Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable `n` is positive or negative. |
| 1-last_digit.c           | Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable `n`.               |
| 2-print_alphabet.c       | Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.                                  |
| 3-print_alphabets.c      | Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.           |
| 4-print_alphabt.c        | Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.                                  |
| 5-print_numbers.c        | Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.        |
| 6-print_numberz.c        | Same as task 5 but only using the `putchar` function. No `char` type variable.                                  |
| 7-print_tebahpla.c       | Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.                          |
| 8-print_base16.c         | Write a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.                    |
| 9-print_comb.c           | Write a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.                                  |
| 10-print_comb2.c         | Write a program that prints the numbers from 00 to 99. Only use `putchar` function. No `char` type variable.    |
| 100-print_comb3.c        | Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits. Same restriction as task 10.     |
| 101-print_comb4.c        | Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits. Same restriction as task 10.   |


### gcc commands

- To create the output file:
```gcc -o [output_file] [source_file]```

- To execute the output file and checking the file contents:
```./[output_file] | cat -e```

- To get what the main function has returned:
```./[output_file] | echo $?```
